Point 12    {soft deletion}:

Soft deleted means that although you have deleted the record through Service Desk the object has been set to soft delete the record.  Therefore instead of completely removing the record it will flag the record as deleted.  For example if you delete an analyst record through Administration it is kept in the database for historic reporting purposes.  You can then still query on this analyst record through query tool  but you will not see it in the Administration list of analysts or when assigning to analysts.  To find all records which have been soft deleted you would query on where deleted = 1.
